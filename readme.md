# Guess A Card

[Visit Webpage](https://guess-a-card-v2.vercel.app)

Guess A Card is a simple browser game built with vanilla javascript, html and css. The first version of this game was built during my introductory phase to javascript. This repository is the second version of the game which features cleaner code and a bit more functionality.

Browse [this repository](https://github.com/ajiohjesse/guess-a-card-V1) for the first version.
